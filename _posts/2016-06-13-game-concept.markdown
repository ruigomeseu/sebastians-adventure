Sebatian's Adventure is a walking simulator. You wake up in an island near an helicopter wreckage, without any memories as to what happened.

In a desperate attempt to understand what happened, you're forced to explore your surroundings, finding clues and items that will help you find your way out of the island.

## Player Motivation

The player is enticed by his unknown surroundings and the story behind his helicopter crash. As the game progresses, the story gets more and more complex and the island's native inhabitants will prove to be a challenge even for the most experienced of the players.

## Unique Selling Proposition

Being a walking simulator, the storyline is the biggest selling point. To differentiate ourselves from other games of the same genre, the team decided to go with a *low poly* graphic style, and implement game mechanics such as a day/night cycle and a time limit to complete the game.

## Target Market

This game is aimed at all players over the age of 16 that enjoy adventure games with a bunch of challenges along the way.

## Genre

Walking Simulator/Adventure Game

## Target Rating

> PEGI 12 - Videogames that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy character and/or non graphic violence towards human-looking characters or recognisable animals, as well as videogames that show nudity of a slightly more graphic nature would fall in this age category. Any bad language in this category must be mild and fall short of sexual expletives.

## Target Platform

Sebastian's Adventure runs on Windows and Mac OS X.

## Game Requirements

Operating System: Windows/Mac OS X
Graphics Card: Any graphics card that supports DX 9.
CPU: Any CPU that supports the SSE2 instruction set.

## Licensing

The game is opensource under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
All the graphical and sound assets were created by the team.

## Competitive Analysis

We identified five different games with similar genres and/or storylines:

- Remember Me
- Lost
- Tomb Raider
- Far Cry
- Uncharted

All these games present some similarity with Sebastian's Adventure, whether it is in a similar environment or an adventurous storyline. However, the combination of the plot and the environment is still a unique one, which gives a competitive edge to our game.
