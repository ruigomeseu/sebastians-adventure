The development of Sebastian's Adventure wouldn't be possible without the help of a variety of people that were essential to the process.

## Teachers

A special thank you to the teachers involved in the project:

- Professor António Coelho
- Professor Eduardo Magalhães
- Professor Pedro Cardoso
- Professor Rui Rodrigues

## Resources

The development of the game wouldn't also be possible without the team behind Unity, the game engine we used to develop this project.
