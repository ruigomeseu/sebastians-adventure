The game was developed using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

Initially released in 2005, Unity is a cross-platform game engine, which is used to develop games for PC, console, mobile devices and even for the web.

The team chose to use C# as the scripting language for the various implemented mechanics, leveraging Unity's APIs to create powerful behavior with simple code.

### Why Unity?

Being first-time game developers, we opted for the game engine that had the most documentation and the smallest learning curve.

With a thriving community, thousands of members on the forums, and many online tutorials covering most of the basics, Unity was the obvious choice and it proved to be a great platform to work with.
